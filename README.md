# Live-Video-Editor
This was a first-year project for a Computer Systems module. The main library that was used for this project is ControlP5, which is commonly used to create a user interface with controllers such as buttons, sliders, textfields etc. This program broadcasts a live video on the display window and enables the user to edit and decorate said video. Through the use of the aforementioned controllers, users can customise the tint and colour of the video, as well as add effects and frames.
